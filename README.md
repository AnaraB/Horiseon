# Horiseon
## Accessible marketing website agency, optimised for search engines

As a front-developer my task is to take existing code and refactor it to meet the standards of **accessibility**.

What are accessibility standards? 

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title


## Installation 

## Usage

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page](assets/images/screenshot.png)


Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and to find the  webpage.
